You may have noticed that last months PLM hasn't been finished, despite being three weeks past. In short, I'm going to be giving it a break for a while. When I started, it was because I enjoyed finding out more about languages, and see them in context. But it's become more of a chore recently. Instead of discovering new things that could be useful, it seems more like learning the bare basics of something with no real benefit. With no direction to take the languages after, learning them doesn't feel meaningful. So I'm ending it for the time being at least. I may continue in the future, but likely as an occasional task rather than every month.

In the meantime, I've been enjoying the holiday while it lasts before uni starts up again. Much less was done than initially planned, but I'm not neccesarily disatisfied with that. I have taken to learning Japanese about 5 months ago near the start of the lockdown, and so far it's been really enjoyable - the language is very different to latin-based languages making it facinating to learn. A friend is also learning the language so comparing our progress is enjoyable.

In addition, I've got a new SSD for my laptop and have installed Arch to give that a try - I'm looking forward to the progress I manage to make with that as an OS. I learned three main things during the install: 1) Backups are useful (I made good use of one) 2) If you're modifying the Windows partition, do it in Windows and 3) Do not trust the default bootloader config in Arch - it uses the USB data, which is obviously wrong.

Finally, I do plan to finish the Perl PLM, just don't expect it to be done by any deadline. Thanks for reading!
