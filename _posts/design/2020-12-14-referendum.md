Normally I prefer to stick to programming or things I've made for this blog, but I felt this is something that was worth saying, and has tangental relevance to programming. For reference, I like in Britain, I was against Brexit, but was unable to vote in the election (but that's not what this argument is about).

It's commonly argued that a second referendum is undemocratic. If you can just have another election for anything, why not have elections all the time! You don't like this election result? Just try again and again until it rolls your way! It's just a method of not accepting a result you didn't like.

To explain why I don't agree with this, I need to explain how software projects are managed. In software development, there are two main overarching methods for creating software. One is known as waterfall, and this involves planning entire project from the start. This can lead to issues if the client changes their mind during the project, or doesn't like the final product. There will need to be significant change to all the tests, documentation and code so a small change can cause a big delay in the project. That said, if you know the client won't change their mind, it's excellent. The plan will let you efficiently create what you planned exactly as planned.

The other common method is called Agile. This is instead made up of a number of 'sprints' where the client and developers work together to decide what to work on for the next few weeks, before doing that. It can take longer than waterfall and is significantly more flexible, as if the client changes their mind, or something unexpected happens, the whole plan doesn't need to be changed - the next sprint can simply focus on this issue. This means the client is much more likely to get exactly what they want, as they're kept informed throughout the process and can explain what they don't like and would prefer as soon as that feature is implemented.

When it comes to a referendum, you're asking the entire country to make a decision on one choice. This is similar to the waterfall method, as only the thoughts of the client before the start of the project are considered. If the requirements or circumstances around the project change, you'll then be delivering the wrong product. Now this is less of a problem with having a second referendum than the idea of a referendum to begin with. By only asking at one point what to do, with no real plan in place, the client is putting all their trust in the developers to create the thing they want, with no oppertunity to give updated requirements. If the developers fail at this, the company will lose reputation and likely a lot if not all of the contract reward.

Now this isn't a bad solution if you trust the government, and the requirements don't change. Now whether you trust the government depends a lot on personal opinion, but I would say the requirements have some change, if from nothing else than the plan not working. The schedule has been pushed back over and over and getting a deal is turning out to be significantly more difficult than expected.

An agile approach would smooth a lot of these issues. By having yearly sprints and asking after each year what the client thinks of the current progress, the client would have a lot more trust in the system, and if something happens to change things, like a pandemic, they can react accordingly. In the end this should never have been a black and white decision. There should have been either no referendum at all, or a constantly updating the requirements over time.

The second referendum after the first may seem like a foolish decision, but what really should have happened is for a series of referendums to be planned from before the first, keeping the country involved in the process until Brexit finally happens. Otherwise the result becomes completely out of your hands.
