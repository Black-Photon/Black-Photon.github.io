		<h3>What am I doing now?</h3>
		<p>
			Working on this site! But other than that I'm learning Unreal so I can create better and more complex games than
			would be possible in OpenGL. In the end Spacial-Freeze was too big a project for me to complete - It turns out
			making OpenGL applications from scratch takes some time. I'm also working on coursework which should be quieting
			around Jan but coming back around Feb/Mar. Finally Michael and I are still putting some time into Metro.
