## 2020
### [April - Ada](/language-of-the-month/04-20/)
First defined in the early 1980's, Ada was ahead of its time and created a secure language still used today for embedded systems and teaching programming.

### [May - Lisp](/language-of-the-month/05-20/)
From its creation in the 1950s, Lisp stood out compared to other languages with its unique usage of Lambda Calculus, and has been the go-to language for many programmers since.

### [June - Rust](/language-of-the-month/06-20/)
A new language, Rust makes use of both low level and high level concepts, merging them together to improve safety as much as possible. Could this be the new C++?

### [July - Perl](/language-of-the-month/07-20/)
Why use `bash` or `powershell` for writing scripts in the modern day? Perl gives a much nicer alternative like python for writing quick solutions to problems.
