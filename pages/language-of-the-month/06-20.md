## Description

June seems like a good month to look into Rust. Rust uses high level paradigms while still allowing low level memory manipulation. It almost seems the best of both worlds! Is it however? The only way to find out is by trying it.

Rust is much newer than the last two languages, so it'll be interesting to see what impact that has on the findings.

## Specification

One of my favourite programming projects was in C++ - Tellas. OpenGL was a blast to use and I mixed Scala in there as well to allow some more control. It'd be enjoyable to go back and try some fancy graphics again, but this time using Rust instead of C++. So the task here is to make a spinning cube! It should have a single light source and basic lighting shaders programmed in. If there's extra time, putting something that can be seen only in the cube would also be cool. But really, the question is whether Rust is as easy, or even easier, to use than C++ in a practical project. We'll soon find out.
