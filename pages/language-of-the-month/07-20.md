## Description

We're onto the real heart of summer now with July. As well all love to hate bash, this seems like the perfect time to look into an alternative - Perl. Like Python, Perl is an interpreted language rather than a compiled, and can be used to simplify tasks. We're going to find out if it really is the replacement you've been searching for.

## Specification

To find how good perl is at bash tasks, there's no better way than use it for something you might use a bash script for. The aim for this month is to create a script that follows a specific set of instructions:
 - Ensure the user meant to run the command by prompting for a `'Y'`, or finding command flag `--noconfirm`
 - Read a list of filenames from `files.txt`
 - Create all of these files in the `files` directory
 - Move all `.txt` files instead to the `docs` directory
 - Any with the word `confidential` in the document should also have read permissions only for the creator
 - A log with the filename of todays date should be created in the `logs` directory containing a list of the new files and their subdirectory

 Such a script seems simple, but whether Perl can do it concisely is yet to be seen...
