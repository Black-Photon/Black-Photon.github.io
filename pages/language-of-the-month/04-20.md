The language for the first month is... Ada! Ada is a language with lots of modern features, yet was conceived much before most languages we know today. It's main use is security, ensuring that as many cases as possible are taken care of at the start, so the final program has less bugs.

Thus, the challenge will be to implement it in a scenario where bugs could be catastropic - A nuclear reactor. Not a real one, but it must calculate and track values to ensure the safe operation. The program must meet this specification:
 - The only value being controlled by the program is how much each control rod is inside the reactor
 - The heat of the reactor should be monitered and controlled by rules
 - The heat dissipate at 5% per second
 - Heat is generated as 2x the current heat in the generator, minus 0.01% (of the final heat) for each 1% a control rod is down
 - There are 100 control rods that can be any integer between 0% and 100% down
 - The heat has a 3% chance of multiplying by 4 instead of 2, and a 3% chance of multiplying by 1 instead of 2
 - Heat generated is equal to heat disipated, and should be maximised if possible
 - When heat reaches 0, the reactor shuts down and must be resparked at 1J
 - When heat reaches 500KJ, the reactor casing begins to melt down, and the reactor should be stopped for massive repair
 - When heat reaches 750KJ, the reactor explodes causing a major disaster
 - The application should print out the current heat and a control rod summary.
 - The application should print errors if either 500KJ or 750KJ are reached
 - The application should require the user to restart the reactor if it reaches 0KJ
 - The reactor should shut down when the user attempts to stop the program running

It's quite a long specification, but we will soon see if Ada is up to the task.
