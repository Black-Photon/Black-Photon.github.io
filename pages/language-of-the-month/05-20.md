## Description

This month we're going to be looking at Lisp! Lisp is a functional programming language from the 50s but isn't pure like Haskell. Yet it still makes good use of lambda calculus in its implementation, compared to most languages focusing on an imperative or object-orientated style, while keeping the potential high speeds of C.

## Specification

The language seems almost like a mix of C, Haskell and Python, which is strange given how different the three are. Thus the challenge is to identify where Lisp differs from these three languages. What parts of it are similar to what? How do they fit together? Here are some specific questions:
 - If one algorithm is easier to write in Haskell, and another in Python, can both algorithms be implemented in Lisp with their shortest form?
 - How does typing compare between them. What are the benefits and drawbacks of such typing?
 - Does the code you write always work when compiled? Are runtime errors common?
 - What kind of functional data structure like Functors and Monads are available?
 - How nice is it to write some basic code in Lisp compared to Python?
 - How low level can it really get?

Compared to last weeks challenge, this is much less concrete, but with luck should be able to showcase the core of Lisp and where it fits into the set of languages. However, there is one final question to also answer: *Should you use lisp?* With luck we'll have the answer by the end of this month.
